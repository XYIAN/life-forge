## [1.0.3] - 2024-12-19

### 🔧 **Hydration Mismatch Fix**

This update fixes a critical hydration error that was occurring on the dashboard page due to time-based content differences between server and client rendering.

### Fixed

- **Hydration Error**: Resolved "Hydration failed because the server rendered text didn't match the client" error
  - **Root Cause**: Time display was updating every second, causing differences between server and client rendering
  - **Solution**: Implemented client-side only rendering for time-dependent content
  - **Approach**: Added `isClient` state to prevent server-side rendering of dynamic time content
- **Time Display**: Fixed time and greeting display to prevent hydration mismatches
  - Added fallback "Loading..." state for time display during initial render
  - Added fallback "Welcome" state for greeting during initial render
  - Ensured consistent rendering between server and client

### Technical

- **Client-Side Rendering**: Implemented proper client-side only rendering for dynamic content
- **State Management**: Added `isClient` flag to control when dynamic content should render
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminated hydration mismatches that could cause React tree regeneration
- **Performance**: Maintained smooth time updates while preventing server/client differences

### User Experience

- **No More Errors**: Dashboard now loads without hydration errors
- **Smooth Loading**: Time display shows "Loading..." briefly before showing actual time
- **Consistent Experience**: No more client-side tree regeneration causing layout shifts
